Parts Implemented by Birkan Denizer
===================================
In this website project, I created picture, attachment and contact entities and their respective user interfaces.
I will walk you through each part picture by picture so you can get sense of how it's actually working.
I will assume that you can imagine filling up forms and pushing submit, update or delete buttons.
